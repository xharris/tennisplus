Eye Dropper is a shader for the Godot engine (`GDShader`) that helps with quick color palette swapping easily customizable through shader parameters.

This shader is a `canvas_item` type of shader that was meant, at least initially, to be used with `CanvasItems` nodes in Godot.
[Contributions](https://github.com/nadjiel/eye-dropper/tree/main#handshake-contributing) are welcome to make a version that works with `3D` nodes.

With this shader, you can configure your palettes through `Textures` or through `PackedColorArrays`, or even use both options, if it's more convenient to you.

## :sparkles: Features

### :paintbrush: Palette Swapping
The main purpose of this project is allowing easy color swapping for `CanvasItems` nodes in the Godot engine.
That's achieved with the `eye_dropper.gdshader` script, which exposes handy properties that can be tweaked programatically, or manually in the Godot editor, in order to achieve different palettes dynamically.

For that palette swapping to happen, two important pair of properties are available in the shader parameters: the `input_palette_array` and `output_palette_array` and the `input_palette_texture` and `output_palette_texture`.

Both of these pair of properties serve the same functionality: allowing you to define what colors should be replaced by what colors in the color swapping process.

The difference between the `Array` based and the `Texture` based properties is that the `Texture` ones are easier if you want to swap quickly from a pre-stablished palette saved in a `Texture` to another one.

The `Array` based, on the other hand makes it easier to swap between palettes that aren't predefined in a texture.
That's useful when you wanna make dynamic color swapping that changes frequently, or even smooth animated color swapping with the use of `Tweens` or `AnimationPlayers`.

There's a catch with the `Array` parameters, though.
To be able to use the palette `Arrays` with various colors, make sure to tweak the `max_palette_array_size` constant in the `eye_dropper.gdshader` file so that it attends your project's needs.

By default, that constant is set to `8`, which means that only `8` colors are allowed at maximum using the `Arrays`, but, as mentioned, that's easily tweakable.

This is implemented that way because, in `GDShaders`, `Arrays` must have a constant initial size predefined, which I decided to let as `8`, initially. 

### :eyeglasses: Transparency support
It's important to note that both the `Texture` and `Array` approaches also support swapping transparent colors, not only opaque ones, so keep that in mind when designing your palettes.

## :books: Documentation
This project is fully documented so that you can understand what each function or property does, just check it out in the `eye_dropper.gdshader` file!

## :test_tube: Testing
This project was manually testedÂ withÂ `GodotÂ 4.3`. Automatic tests weren't written since `GDShaders` generally can't be tested that way, at least to my knowledge.
